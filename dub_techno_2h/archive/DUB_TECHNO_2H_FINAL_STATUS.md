## NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE

The **foundation is 100% complete**. To finish the track:

### 1. Configure Instruments (in Ableton)

**Time Required**: 10-15 minutes

- Open each instrument device
- Choose appropriate presets or design sounds
- **Kick**: Design punchy kick or use preset
- **Sub-bass**: Design deep sub sound
- **Hi-hats**: Load hi-hat samples in Drum Rack
- **Synth Pads**: Choose atmospheric pad presets
- **FX**: Load FX samples (sweeps, impacts)

Reference: **`DUB_TECHNO_2H_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`** for detailed settings

### 2. Set Up Send Routing (in Ableton)

**Time Required**: 5 minutes

For each main track (4-9):
1. Expand mixer section (click track header)
2. Click "Sends" button
3. Set Send A (Reverb) and Send B (Delay) levels:

| Track | Reverb Send | Delay Send |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 4 - Kick | 0% | 0% |
| 5 - Sub-bass | 0% | 5-10% |
| 6 - Hi-hats | 20-30% | 25-35% |

- Peaks: Decrease to 20-30%
- Use smooth curves

### 6. Test Playback

**Time Required**: 2 hours (full listen!)

1. Start playback from Section 0
2. Listen through all 30 sections
3. Check transitions (every 4 minutes)
4. Adjust mix levels as needed
5. Refine automation

---

## HOW TO PLAY THE TRACK

### Option 1: Use Arrangement Script

```bash
python arrange_2h_dub_techno.py
```

This will:
1. Fire clips for Section 0 (Deep Intro)
2. Start playback
3. Clips will continue playing (looping)

**Note**: You'll need to manually trigger scene changes every 4 minutes

### Option 2: Manual Scene Triggering

In Ableton Session View:
1. Click on scene (horizontal row) to trigger all clips
2. Press Play or Space to start playback
3. Launch different scenes to progress through sections

### Option 3: Use Arrangement View

1. Switch to Arrangement View (Tab key)
2. Select clips and drag to timeline
3. Arrange 30 sections linearly
4. Use Scene Launch to trigger arrangement

## SCRIPT USAGE

### Create Everything (Fresh Start)

```bash
# 1. Set tempo
python -c "import socket, json; s = socket.socket(); s.connect(('localhost', 9877)); s.send(json.dumps({'type': 'set_tempo', 'params': {'tempo': 126.0}}).encode('utf-8')); print(json.loads(s.recv(8192).decode('utf-8'))); s.close()"

# 2. Create tracks and clips
python create_2h_dub_techno.py
