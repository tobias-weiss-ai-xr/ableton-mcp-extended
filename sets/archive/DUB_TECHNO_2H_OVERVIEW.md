## NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE

### 1. Load Instruments and Sounds

**Kick Track (Track 4)**
- Load a punchy kick drum synth or sample
- Recommended: Operator, Analog, or sample
- Set envelope: fast attack, short decay
- Add slight saturation for warmth

**Sub-bass Track (Track 5)**
- Load a deep sub-bass synth
- Recommended: Operator, Tension, or Serum
- Filter: Low-pass at ~100-200 Hz
- Add compression to glue the sound
- Sidechain against kick for groove

**Hi-hat Track (Track 6)**
- Load hi-hat samples or synth
- Recommended: Drum Rack with samples
- Add slight reverb send
- Use EQ to clean high frequencies

**Synth Pads Track (Track 7)**
- Load atmospheric pad synth
- Recommended: Analog, Wavetable, or Diva
- Add heavy reverb (Large Hall)
- Filter: Low-pass filter automation
- Use stereo width plugin for depth

**FX Track (Track 8)**
- Load sampler or noise generator
- Recommended: Simpler with FX samples
- Add reverb sends for atmosphere
- Use filters for sweeps

**Dub Delays Track (Track 9)**
- This is a SEND track - load delays here
- Recommended: Simple Delay, Ping Pong Delay
- Add reverb after delay
- Filter delays for warmth

### 2. Add Effects (Essential for Dub Techno)

**Essential Effects Chain:**

**On Master:**
- Limiter (for final loudness)
- Multiband dynamics (optional)

**On Sub-bass Track:**
- EQ: Boost 50-100 Hz, cut above 200 Hz
- Compressor: Threshold -12dB, ratio 4:1
- Sidechain: Duck against kick

**On Synth Pads Track:**
- Reverb: Large Hall, 40-60% wet
- Delay: Ping Pong, 1/4 notes
- Low-pass filter: Automate for depth

**On Send Tracks:**
- Create 2 send tracks:
  - Reverb Send: Large Hall reverb
  - Delay Send: Dub delay (1/4 or 1/8 notes)

**Send routing:**
- Send Kick: 0%
- Send Sub-bass: 5-10%
- Send Hi-hats: 20-30%
- Send Pads: 40-50%
- Send FX: 60-70%
- Send Delays: 80-100%

### 3. Mixing Tips

**Balance:**
- Kick: Reference point (-6 to -8 dB)
- Sub-bass: -3 to -6 dB relative to kick
- Hi-hats: -12 to -15 dB
- Pads: -18 to -24 dB
- FX: -15 to -20 dB

**EQ Guidelines:**
- Kick: Boost 60-100 Hz
- Sub-bass: Boost 50-80 Hz
- Hi-hats: Boost 8-12 kHz
- Pads: Boost 1-3 kHz (presence), cut below 300 Hz
- FX: Wide spectrum, careful of low-mid buildup

**Compression:**
- Kick: Fast attack, medium release
- Sub-bass: Slow attack, medium release
- Hi-hats: Medium attack, fast release
- Master: Gentle glue compression

### 4. Automation and Evolution

**To create the hypnotic evolution over 2 hours:**

**Filter Automation:**
- Automate low-pass filters on pads
- Open filters during peaks, close during breakdowns
- Gradual movement over sections

**Reverb Sends:**
- Increase reverb during breakdowns
- Decrease during peak sections
- Automate for smooth transitions

**Delay Sends:**
- More delays during hypnotic sections
- Stutter delays for accents
- Echo builds for transitions

**Volume Automation:**
- Subtle level changes between sections
- Builds increase volume slightly
- Breakdowns decrease volume

### 5. Live Performance Tips

**Since this is a 2-hour journey:**
- Monitor the mix periodically
- Adjust sections if they feel too long or short
- Add manual transitions between sections if needed
- Use clip stop/start for dramatic changes
- Add real-time effects on the fly
