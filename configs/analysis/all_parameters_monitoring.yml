# All Parameters Monitoring Scenario
# This configuration monitors all analysis parameters without taking control actions
# Useful for understanding what parameters reveal about your audio

  # Rule 7: Peak detection alert
  - name: "Peak level alert"
    priority: 10
    condition:
      parameter: "Peak Level"
      operator: ">"
      value: 0.95  # Near clipping
    action:

    cooldown: 500

# Configuration notes:
# - This is a monitoring-only configuration (no control actions)
# - Uses "log" action type instead of parameter/volume actions
# - All rules fire based on actual parameter values
# - Different cooldown rates for different monitoring frequencies
# - Useful for understanding how parameters correlate with audio content
